*** TO DO ***

in-Manager contributions to Mail merge output

?? email: one only to each address, unless it's been "individualized"

remove follow_up by date -- put it in the memo field

"quick create" entities/new form

Contributions and pledged contributions => decimal, not float (need to check Rails version for support)

"export everything" command -- the "get me out of here" option
CSV file with every entity column, volunteer_tasks, groups, tags, emails, addresses, contributions, contact_texts?

Data/Reports section: select fields to export as CSV (have simple defined sets?)

think about file download not going through Mongrel
http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/123638

caching: 
	* put user, role, and cur models in memcached

"crumb bar" at the top of the page Campaign > Committees > List (or just in page title?)

*** Mobile Access ***

My cell phone's User-Agent = "HTC-3100/1.2 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows CE; Smartphone; 240x320)"

uentities/show/:id

*** role and permissions ***
add role-checking into display of edit panes on entities/show
	see voter_info_box for ideas
	add campaign to local variables passed to show partials, so that each one doesn't have to look it up again
	campaigns: roles check, cur create on campaign create
	users: roles on campaigns
	
update permissions for volunteer_events and contact_events	
	
create checking functions for each used combination

roles:
	1 SuperUser
	2 Manager
	3 Edit finances & Groups
	4 Edit Groups
	5 Edit only entity properties
	6 Read Only
	7 Sign In/out only
	8 Inactive

*** entities ***

* Treasurer mapping
* Field mapping

*** SEARCH ***
add searching on contact history (including campaign events), (group membership with role?)

save queries easily, probably an ez_where conditions object (check out Ambition)
create complex queries
	* store hash/array version of the most recent advanced search in session
		h = {:phone=>[:includes,"626"], :email_ok=>[:matches,"Yes"]} etc
	* display search parameters (based on the search_hash)
		link to "refine search"
		advanced_search view opens and sets values for search_hash if "refine==1"
	* search financial information
		-- contributions stored locally
		-- query Treasurer

*** features to add *** 

Household add and remove: change to POST from GET

SORT for Mail Merge, Labels: by zip code?

groups: custom fields? -- if demanded, it's there in the db structure (group_field)

*** feature requests ***
	* send attachments to email list

*** useful code ***
onfocus="if (this.value == 'Display name') {this.value='';}" onblur="if(this.value == '') this.value='Display name';"
:onfocus=>"if (this.value == 'Enter name here') {this.value='';}", :onblur=>"if(this.value == '') this.value='Enter name here';"
