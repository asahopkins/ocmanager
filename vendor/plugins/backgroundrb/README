BackgrounDRb is a small framework for divorcing long running tasks from
Rails request/response cycle. With HTTP it is usually not a very good
idea to keep a request waiting for a response for long running actions.
BackgrounDRb also allows for status updates that in combination with
ajax can render live progress bars in the browser while the background
worker task gets completed. The MiddleMan can also be used as a cache.
You can store rendered templates or compute intensive results in the
MiddleMan for use later.

The MiddleMan drb server is a front controller or factory/delegate type
of object. It straddles the relationship between the drb server and your
rails app. It takes instructions from you and instantiates your worker
objects with the args you send from rails. It uses a hash to keep a  key
pointing to a running worker that is also put into the session in rails
so rails can find the same Worker object that is running its job on
subsequent requests. The MiddleMan front object has a method that takes
a class type as a symbol  and instantiates a new instance of said
class type. Then it returns a job_key to the client(rails). Rails can
then call a method on that object through the MiddleMan class.

There are many possible use cases for this system. More will be implemented
soon. This is an open request for comments and feature requests. 

Let's look at how this system works in detail.

*Home page: http://backgroundrb.rubyforge.org
*svn repo: svn://rubyforge.org//var/svn/backgroundrb
*Mailing list: http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/backgroundrb-devel

To install BackgrounDRb you need to follow these steps:

**Important**
  if you have already installed this plugin and you are upgrading you
  need to blow away your config/backgroundrb.yml file and let it get
  generated again to pick up new options.

1. Install the plugin in your vendor/plugins directory
$ script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org//var/svn/backgroundrb

2. To install start stop scripts and worker dir:
$ rake backgroundrb:setup

3. After you run the setup task take a look in RAILS_ROOT/config/backgroundrb.log.
  This is the config file for the drb server where you can set the port and host
  as well as whether or not to load your rails models for use in a worker class.

4. There are now rake tasks to start and stop the drb server.
$ rake backgroundrb:start
and
$ rake backgroundrb:stop

*** If you are on windows you can't use the rake tasks to start and stop the server.
Instead use the script directly but don't supply the -d option. In windows there is
no fork so until I get time to create a windows service you need to have a console
windows open with backgroundrb running in n it.

> ruby script/backgroundrb/start


# start the server on port 11111 in the background.
$ script/backgroundrb/start -p 11111 -d

5. Here are some capistrano tasks for stopping, starting and restarting the drb server

# for deploy.rb

desc <<-DESC
Stop the backgroundrb server
DESC
task :stop_backgroundrb , :roles => :drb do
  run "#{current_path}/script/backgroundrb/stop"
end

desc <<-DESC
Start the backgroundrb server
DESC
task :start_backgroundrb , :roles => :drb do
  run "#{current_path}/script/backgroundrb/start -d"
end

desc <<-DESC
Start the backgroundrb server
DESC
task :restart_backgroundrb , :roles => :app do
  stop_backgroundrb
  start_backgroundrb
end


6. There is also a worker class generator. 
Description:
    The worker generator creates stubs for a new worker.

    The generator takes a worker name as its argument.  The worker name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Worker'.

    The generator creates a worker class in lib/workers and a test suite in
    test/unit.

Example:
    ./script/generate worker Tail

    This will create an Tail worker:
        Model:      lib/workers/tail_worker.rb
        Test:       test/unit/tail_worker_test.rb



Lets look at a simple worker class. This is a new improved way to 
create your worker classes. You just need to inherit from
BackgrounDRb::Rails and define a do_work(args) method. This
method will automatically get called in its own thread when you
create a new worker from rails. So when you say:

MiddleMan.new_worker :class => :foo_worker, :args => "Hello!"

The "Hello" argument gets sent to your do_work method.

# Put your code that runs your task inside the do_work method
# it will be run automatically in a thread. You have access to
# all of your rails models if you set load_rails to true in the
# config file. You also get @logger inside of this class by default.
class FooWorker < BackgrounDRb::Rails
  
  def do_work(args)
    # This method is called in it's own new thread when you
    # call new worker. args is set to :args
  end

end

When you are done with work in your worker class you can delete the worker
from the MiddleMan from within your worker class by calling kill()

Your worker classes go into the RAILS_ROOT/lib/workers/ directory.
Use the rake task to generate new workers. It will first check to
make sure your worker classes don't conflict with other class names
in your application. 

You can then use your worker class in rails like this:

# in a controller

# start new worker and put the job_key into the session so you can
# get the status of your job later.
def background_task
  session[:job_key] = MiddleMan.new_worker(:class => :foo_worker,
                                           :args => {:baz => 'hello!', :qux => 'another arg!'})
end

def task_progress
  if request.xhr?
    progress_percent = MiddleMan.get_worker(session[:job_key]).progress
    render :update do |page|
      page.call('progressPercent', 'progressbar', progress_percent)        
      page.redirect_to( :action => 'done')   if progress_percent >= 100
    end
  else
    redirect_to :action => 'index'   
  end
end

def results
  @results = MiddleMan.get_worker(session[:job_key]).results
  MiddleMan.delete_worker(session[:job_key])
end

Note that new_worker takes a hash as the argument. the :class  part of 
the hash is required so MiddleMan knows which worker class to instantiate.
You can give it either an underscore version like :foo_worker or normal 
like :FooWorker. Also the :args key points to a value that will be 
given to your worker class when initialized. By default your worker 
classes will be :immortal. Which means the only way to kill one is
to use delete_worker or gc!. But you can specify a 
:ttl(time to live) in seconds and your worker will get killed after
those seconds run out. The following will start a FooWorker class
with a text argument of "Bar" and a time to live of 5 minutes

session[:job_key] = MiddleMan.new_worker(:class => :foo_worker,
                                         :args => "Bar",
                                         :ttl => 300)	
**NEW** There is another option you can specify when creating new workers.
It sets the time to live to act like a session. So it will update the timestamp
when it gets accessed and push the time to live forward again. This allows the
worker to expire based on time to live since the worker was last accessed. So
this worker will expire 300 seconds after the last time it was accessed.

session[:job_key] = MiddleMan.new_worker(:class => :foo_worker,
                                         :args => "Bar",
                                         :ttl => 300,
                                         :expire_type => :accessed )



In the background_task view you can use periodically_call_remote
to ping the task_progress method to get the progress of your job and update
the progress bar. Once progress is equal to 100(or whatever you want) you
redirect to the results page to display the results of the worker task.

See examples/css.js.progressbar.txt for pure css/js progress bar graphic 
examples. Thanks to Werner Bohl for making the css/js progress example.

There are a few simple examples in the workers dir.

If you want to have a named key instead of generated key you can specify the
key yourself. This is handy for creating shared resources that more then one
user will access so that multiple users and backends can get the same object
by name. Remember since we don't set a :ttl here this worker will be immortal
and you will need to delete_worker on it yourself or use MiddeleMan.gc! to over
ride the immortality and kill the worker.

MiddleMan.new_worker(:class => :foo_worker,
                     :args => "Bar",
                     :job_key => :shared_resource)

Then you can access it by name:

MiddleMan[:shared_resource]
or
MiddleMan.get_worker(:shared_resource)

There is also now an option to have a singleton worker so there is always
only one of a certain worker. Even if you call new_worker twice with this
option enabled you will get back the same instance of the class. Do not
create a worker class and use it as a singleton and a non singleton worker
at the same time. This is not supported.

MiddleMan.new_worker(:class => :foo_worker,
                     :args => "Bar",
                     :job_key => :singleton_worker,
                     :singleton => true)

For caching ActiveRecord Objects you can now use the following syntax.
**Notice that MiddleMan.cache_get can take an optional block so that if
there is nothing in the cache, it will get filled with the contents of
the block. The second parameter to cache_as is a time to live setting
in *seconds* so in the examples 300 is 5 minutes before the cache will 
expire. If you don't specify a :ttl then the cache will be held for 10 
minutes and then get terminated.

# fill cache, expire in 5 minutes
@tags = Tag.find(:all, :include => :meta_tags)
MiddleMan.cache_as(:post_cache, 300, @posts)
#OR

@tags = MiddleMan.cache_as :tags_cache, 300 do
  Tag.find(:all, :include => :meta_tags)
end

#retrieve_cache, if the cache for the :tags_cache key
# is empty, rebuild it with the data inside the block
# and return the query to fill @tags. 
@tags = MiddleMan.cache_get : tags_cache, 300 do
  Tag.find(:all, :include => :meta_tags)
end


When you cache AR objects MiddleMan needs to have access to the model classes.
When your objects get cached they first get marshaled into memory in the drb
server. And when you want to get one back and unmarshal it you need the classes
of whatever you cached available. So until I come up with something better, you 
will need to specify your models that you plan on caching in application.rb 
like this:

model :post
model :comment

You could create this cache and then have an ActiveRecord observer
expire the cache and create a new one when the data changes.

If you know you are done with an object then its a good idea to explicitely flush
it. So you can run delete_worker on the job_key to get rid of it. But with the new
built in timer/gc you can just specify a time to live when you create a new worker.

MiddleMan.delete_worker(session[:job_key])

There is also a MiddleMan.gc! method that you can run and give a time object
that will expire everything older then the timestamp you pass in. You should use
the new timer and :ttl code instead of doing this though as it is fewer moving
parts. But here is a ruby script you could run from cron that will delete all workers and cached items older then 30 minutes if you still need it.
 **WARNING** using gc! overrides immortal workers and deletes them as well.

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "drb"
DRb.start_service
MiddleMan = DRbObject.new(nil, "druby://localhost:22222")
MiddleMan.gc!(Time.now - 60*30)

**NEW FEATURES**

You can now have workers that autostart when the drb server is started, and you can also
have cron like workers that run at intervals. To specify a worker to startup when the 
drb server does you can add something liek this to your backgroundrb.yml config file:

autostart:
  1:
    job_key: email_checker1
    class: email_checker_worker
  2:
    job_key: email_checker2
    class: email_checker_worker

Change job_key to be the actual named key you want to use for this autostart worker. 
In you workers you can now have timed tasks that repeat themselves at intervals that you set.
A simple example looks like this:

class CronWorker <BackgrounDRb::Rails  

  repeat_every 10.minutes
  first_run Time.now

  def do_work(args)
    @progress ||= 0
    @progress += 1
  end
  
  def progress
    @progress
  end      
end

repeat_every takes anything that can be made into a Time object via Time.parse. Same 
thing with first_run. You can use all the nice rails active support time methods in these
declarations like 2.hours and friends.

** ROADMAP **
1. **DONE** Add better ActiveRecord caching facilities. Right now you can cache any object
   that can be marshalled with Marshal.dump
2. More examples. A chat room is forthcoming as well as an email queue.
3. **DONE** More documentation.
4. **DONE** Make an installer?
5. **DONE** Possibly add a thread in MiddleMan that sleeps for a certain amount of time and wakes 
   up to call MiddleMan#gc! and garbage collect old or orphaned objects. Could also possibly have
   callbacks to call certain workers at timed intervals.
6. **DONE** Finally get a rubyforge project and mailing lists and all that jazz.
7. **DONE** Added support for using AR models in the workers.
8. Profit.. ?
