INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Download the most recent snapshot, and expand the compressed archive, or checkout the most recent release from the Subversion repository.

Follow the installation instructions at http://www.rubyonrails.org/down
-- Install ruby (already installed on many servers, as well as Mac OS X)
-- Install rubygems

NOTE: Open Campaigns Manager runs on Rails version 1.2.6.  This version of rails is included in the distribution of Manager, in the vendor/rails folder, so you don't have to install this version separately through rubygems if you don't want it.

Make sure that the following gems are installed:
pdf-writer
RDiscount
fastercsv
mongrel
rubypants

Edit three files:
config/database.yml
	Copy database.example.yml to database.yml, editing to configure for your database connection.

config/email_config.rb
	Copy email_config.example.rb to email_config.rb, editing to setup your email accounts:
	SERVER_NAME: domain name for your mail service
	BOUNCE_ADDRESS: email address you want bounced emails to be returned to (IMAP)
	BOUNCE_PASSWORD: password for this account
	EMAIL_FROM: Email address that emails to users will be sent from
	ADMIN_EMAIL: Destination email for user system errors
	APP_URL: URL to your application

config/server_config.rb
	Copy email_config.example.rb to email_config.rb, editing to setup your email accounts:
		TRIGGER_FILE is a path to a file that tells the application you are running in your secure production environment
		REMOTE_PROTOCOL set to https:// for secure connections, http:// for insecure (look elsewhere for info on setting up a secure server, SSL, etc)
		LOCAL_PROTOCOL should almost always be set to http:// -- this is for local development
		REMOTE_DOWNLOAD_PATH: edit the leading part of this path for your remote/production server to point to the exported_files folder in the application
		LOCAL_DOWNLOAD_PATH: sim. but for local/development machine
		
Run "rake db:schema:load" from the top directory of your copy of Manager

Run ./script/server from the top directory of Manager

Direct your web browser to http://localhost:3010/manager

First, we need to set up the "superuser" account first.  Enter the email address, first and last name of this user.

Log in with that email address and the emailed password.  The first screen won't make any sense.
Enter the following location in your web browser: http://localhost:3010/manager/campaigns/new
Enter the name of the campaign, and the email address you want to send email from for this campaign; click "Create".

Click "Edit Account" under the admin account's name in the left-hand navigation column.  Enter a new password (twice) in the appropriate spots on the form, and then click "Change password".

Click "logout" in the left-hand navigation column, and login with the email address and password you just set.
